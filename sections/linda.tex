Dear Ms Kusters,
My name is Linda Graupe and I'm studying at Humboldt University in Berlin. At the moment i write on my bachelor thesis. A few days ago i asked Thomas Geißler for help. He suggested me to contact you with my question. The topic of my bachelor thesis is the prejudice and beliefs concerning hard – hearing and deaf people. I will analize this topic with two main aspects. The first one should answer the question, if there is more prejudice concerning d/Deaf and hard – hearing persons, when the hearing person belongs to an older group of society than the younger ones. Is there a correlation concerning hearing society and the age of someone? The second main aspect will answer the question, if there is a correlation between  prejudice concerning d/Deaf and hard – hearing persons and density of population. Is there less prejudice by hearing persons in bigger towns or citys than in smaller villages?
Thomas Geißler and also Claudia Becker, our supervisor, told me, that there has already been research concerning this topic. So here is my question: Do you know studies, which are similar to mine? Could you please tell me, where i can find some reference?
Thanks a lot for your support!
Yours sincerely,
Linda Graupe
